            Introduction
        </h2>
        <br>
        My name is Niall Curtis, and I am a Computer Science Undergraduate studying at Cardiff University as of 2016. I am interested in learning all faucets of development, however I am particularly interested in all aspects of web development and design.

            Education
        </h2>
        <br>
        I studied at <span class="b">Sir Thomas Picton</span> school from 2009-2016, including both GCSEs and A-levels, the latter of which I studied Physics, Maths and ICT along with Welsh Baccalaureate attaining grades of A*ACC. I chose my A-levels specifically with the idea of Computer Science in mind as I knew they all had their benefits that linked with this field.
        <hr class="rule">
        As previously mentioned, I currently study <span class="b">Computer Science at Cardiff University</span> and I currently plan on undertaking a Year in Industry to further my learning and skills, as well as gain employment experience and possibly propel myself into a job. I am currently unsure of what career path to take post-degree, but I am hoping that through my studies it will become clearer. Where I am now, I heavily enjoy web design
        and am looking forward to studying more in-depth web development solutions. Thus far on the course, as the team leader of a small group, we created a text-based adventure within Python, which I was heavily involved with on the programming side and managing the tasks of the other group members. I also enjoyed much of the Python programming work we have done so far including the larger scale project to simulate squash games. I also started on web design via a simple website for our web applications module, and I have an in-progress website for my grandad's business which I plan on working on as I learn more advanced web development techniques across the year. All of these are available publicly <a class="link" href="https://github.com/xNiallC" style="font-style: italic;">here, on my GitHub page.</a>

            Professional Experience
        </h2>
        <br>
        I have spent time in a few entry-level jobs that have given be a base level experience of life in the workplace, as well as some of the simple yet valuable skills this teaches you - professionalism, being on time, dealing with customers/clients, management and everything else you would expect from a teenager's part time job. As well as working in a couple of local businesses, I have also worked more practically with my grandad at his building company which gave me a taste of the wider world of work.

            Skills
        </h2>
        <br>
        Through my years of education across school, sixth form and university, as well as in work, I have acquired a number of skills that can improve my employability. Having undertaken many years of formal education, I have a strong ability to quickly learn both new aspects of familiar subjects, and brand new subjects entirely. Through having a number of part-time jobs in different sectors of employment, I have obtained a wide range of work experience. From working directly with particular clients in a department store, to managing customers and stock in a local store, to practical work and client specification on a building site, I feel that I can easily adapt all I have learned to any new job situation along with the theoretical "book work" from education. 
        <hr class="rule">
        As someone who is to a certain extent a perfectionist, I have always liked to have management or leadership roles when undertaking group work. Since school with various enterprise projects through the years as well as group coursework, I have quickly learnt vital skills for managing people, even if it's only at a small scale level so far. I became proficient in delegating roles related to individual skills, assigning tasks, ensuring work is done, project control and where neccessary being firm to make certain the job is complete.
        <hr class="rule">
        I am personally very self-critical, and am very particular about work I do for myself. Practically, this means I do all my work to a standard that I myself consider excellent, however long this will take. Especially when programming, if I see an aspect of my project that I would like to create/improve then I will undertake whatever learning or research that it will take to do this. I am also a very meticulous time keeper and never like to be late or rushed, so I always get things done on time and arrive early for physical events. I also strive to be a keen learner and enjoy taking in advice and criticism to both make my work better, and improve my skills in the future.
