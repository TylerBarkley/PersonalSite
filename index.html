            Introduction
        </h2>
        <br>
        My name is Niall Curtis, and I am a Computer Science Undergraduate studying at Cardiff University as of 2016. I am interested in learning all faucets of development, however I am particularly interested in all aspects of web development and design.

            Education
        </h2>
        <br>
        I studied at <span class="b">Sir Thomas Picton</span> school from 2009-2016, including both GCSEs and A-levels, the latter of which I studied Physics, Maths and ICT along with Welsh Baccalaureate attaining grades of A*ACC. I chose my A-levels specifically with the idea of Computer Science in mind as I knew they all had their benefits that linked with this field.
        <hr class="rule">
        As previously mentioned, I currently study <span class="b">Computer Science at Cardiff University</span> and I currently plan on undertaking a Year in Industry to further my learning and skills, as well as gain employment experience and possibly propel myself into a job. I am currently unsure of what career path to take post-degree, but I am hoping that through my studies it will become clearer. Where I am now, I heavily enjoy web design
        and am looking forward to studying more in-depth web development solutions. Thus far on the course, as the team leader of a small group, we created a text-based adventure within Python, which I was heavily involved with on the programming side. I also enjoyed much of the Python programming work we have done so far including the larger scale project to simulate squash games. I also started on web design via a simple website for our web applications module. All of these are available publicly <a class="link" href="https://github.com/xNiallC" style="font-style: italic;">here, on my GitHub page.</a>

            Professional Experience
        </h2>
        <br>
        I have spent time in a few entry-level jobs that have given be a base level experience of life in the workplace, as well as some of the simple yet valuable skills this teaches you - professionalism, being on time, dealing with customers/clients, management and everything else you would expect from a teenager's part time job. As well as working in a couple of local businesses, I have also worked more practically with my grandad at his building company which gave me a taste of the wider world of work.
